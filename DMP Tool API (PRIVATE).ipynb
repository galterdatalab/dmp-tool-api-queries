      "        \"description\": \"<p>Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and significantly affects patient outcomes in kidney transplantation and critical care. With over 72,864 end-stage kidney disease patients awaiting transplants, kidneys are highly susceptible to IRI due to unavoidable ischemic periods during procurement and transplantation. This often results in delayed graft function (DGF) in 21.3% of U.S. kidney transplant recipients, necessitating dialysis within seven days post-transplant and adversely impacting patient outcomes. Additionally, AKI affects up to 50\\u201360% of intensive care unit patients, exacerbating the challenges in managing kidney injury in critical care settings. Currently, there are no effective therapies to mitigate IRI, highlighting an urgent need for effective strategies. Renal endothelial cells (ECs), among the first affected by IRI, trigger inflammatory cascades that exacerbate renal injury. Because of their central role in this process, directly targeting ECs holds significant therapeutic potential. One promising approach involves the use of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor with known immunosuppressive properties. However, its widespread distribution and off-target effects limit its efficacy.</p> <p>Building on our previous work with poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-b-PPS) polymersomes (PS) to induce anti-inflammatory phenotypes in monocyte lineage cells, we propose to repurpose rapamycin for targeted delivery to renal ECs. During the K99 training phase, we will develop rapamycin-loaded PS (rPS) and functionalize them with fucoidan using a rapid, simple tannic acid (TA)-FeIII coating technique in aqueous conditions, designed to target the overexpression of P-selectin on activated renal ECs during IRI. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that fucoidan decorated TA-FeIII rPS (FrPS) achieves predominant uptake by renal ECs. In Aim 2, we will investigate the therapeutic impact of ex vivo pretreated renal grafts with FrPS in mitigating IRI during kidney transplantation. In the R00 independent phase, we aim to translate these findings into a systemic therapy for AKI. We will develop a systemic rapamycin formulation to target renal ECs through fucoidan coated TA-FeIII Kolliphor\\u00ae HS 15 (Fsol, an inactive ingredient listed in the FDA database that dissolves rapamycin powder directly without requiring organic solvents), which will produce nanoparticles less than 20\\u202fnm for intravenous administration. In Aim 3, we will develop and characterize the systemic Fsol formulation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the efficacy of P-selectin targeting Fsol in a murine bilateral renal IRI model.</p> <p>This K99/R00 research introduces a novel, targeted therapeutic strategy to mitigate IRI by inducing anti-inflammatory phenotypes in renal ECs, potentially improving outcomes for kidney transplant and AKI patients. Successful completion will provide comprehensive insights into renal EC immunobiology and support my transition to an independent investigator focused on developing innovative treatments for kidney diseases.</p>\",\n",
